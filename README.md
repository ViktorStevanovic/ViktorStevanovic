Hello everyone! ðŸ˜Š

I'm Viktor Stevanovic, a passionate web developer fresh out of bootcamp and a huge manga lover! ðŸš€

I'm comfortable with HTML, CSS, and SCSS, turning ideas into engaging and functional designs. In the realm of scripting, I navigate JavaScript with ease, particularly favoring Vue.js for crafting dynamic user interfaces.

But wait, there's more! I also have a backend knack. I'm proficient in PHP and Laravel, adept at handling MySQL databases to create robust and scalable applications.

I'm here to learn, grow, and share my passion for web development and manga!

If you want to talk code, share ideas, or simply discuss the latest adventures of your favorite manga, feel free to reach out!

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹
